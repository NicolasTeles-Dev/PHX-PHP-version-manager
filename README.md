`phx` is a **simple, fast, and compilation-free** PHP version manager, inspired by tools such as `nvm` and `pyenv`.

It works **exclusively with PHP versions already installed on the system**
(`apt`, `brew`, etc.), using *shims* to switch versions automatically
by project or globally.

## 🤔 How it works

`phx` uses the concept of **shims**:

1. It creates the directory `~/.phx/shims`
2. This directory is added to the beginning of `PATH`
3. Shims are **symbolic links** (`php`, `phpize`, etc.)
4. When changing versions, `phx` only updates these links

The active version is determined by priority:

1. `.phx-version` file in the directory (or above)
2. Global version (`phx global`)
3. System PHP

All of this happens **automatically at each shell prompt**.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
https://github.com/NicolasTeles-Dev/PHX-PHP-version-manager.git
cd PHX
```

### 2️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
chmod +x phx
sudo cp phx /usr/local/bin/phx
```

#### Check:

```bash
phx --help
```

### 3️⃣ Enable PHX in the shell

#### Run once:

```bash
eval “$(phx init -)”
```

#### Then add this same line to your shell:

```bash
Zsh → ~/.zshrc
Bash → ~/.bashrc
```

#### Add this line:
```bash
eval “$(phx init -)”
```

#### Restart the terminal or run:
```bash
exec zsh
# or
exec bash
```

### ✅ Done

#### PHX is now active.

##### Confirm:

```bash
phx list
```

### 💻 Usage

#### List available versions

```bash
phx list
```

#### Set global version

```bash
phx global 8.3
php -v
```

#### Set version per project

```bash
cd my-project
phx local 8.4
php -v
```

#### This creates a file in the directory.
```bash
phx-version 
``` 

#### View active version

```bash
phx current
```

#### View which PHP is being used

```bash
phx which
```

#### Show phx version

```bash
phx version
```

### ⚙️ Optional configuration

#### By default, phx searches for PHP versions in:

```bash
/usr/bin
```

#### If you use other paths (e.g., Homebrew), set them before init:

```bash
export PHX_BIN_PATHS_DEFAULT="/usr/bin /opt/homebrew/bin"
```

#### You can use multiple paths separated by spaces.
